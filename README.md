Simply open `index.html` in your browser or deploy to any static hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

### Local Development:
```bash
# No build process required - just open the file
open index.html
# or serve with any static server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

### Deployment:
This is a static site that can be deployed anywhere:
- **Vercel**: `vercel --prod`
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the folder
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to a repository and enable Pages

## File Structure

```
/
├── index.html          # Main website file
├── styles.css          # All styling and responsive design
├── script.js           # Interactive functionality and form handling
├── vercel.json         # Vercel deployment configuration
├── package.json        # Project metadata (no dependencies needed)

## How It Works

### Business Application Process:
1. Business fills out the registration form
2. Form validation ensures all required fields are completed
3. JavaScript generates a pre-filled email with all application details
4. User's default email client opens with the application ready to send
5. Business sends email to `info@localtreasure.com` to complete application
